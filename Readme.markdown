# Solution for Local Storage challenge (the Todo list)

This repository includes two branches:

* [master](https://github.com/CoderAcademy-BRI/localstorage-todo-list/tree/master): This is the solution we worked through in class. It stores tasks as a comma separated string in localStorage
* [json_storage](https://github.com/CoderAcademy-BRI/localstorage-todo-list/tree/json_storage): This is a further iteration on the todo list. This version has a central `tasks` array to hold tasks. This array is converted to JSON for saving to local storage.
